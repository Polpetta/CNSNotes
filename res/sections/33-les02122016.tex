\section{Scalable Embedded Device Attestation}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{Verifier} selects random device ($D_1$) initializes attestation
	\item Spanning tree is created rooted at $D_1$
	\item Each device gets attested by its parent (leaves first)
	\item Parents accumulate results and report to their parent
	\item $D_1$ reports overall result to \textit{verifier}
\end{enumerate}

Remember that this system is vulnerable to physical attacks. How can we handle 
physical attacks? If an attacker compromise every device we're done.

\subsection{Physical Attacks}
In physical attacks, we need at least one good device; so an attacker can 
attack in two ways: physical and through software.
Each physically attacked device is inaccessible for non-negligible period, to 
check if a device is alive, it have to send an heartbeat.
