\section{Signal-based Key Generation Protocols}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Secure communication requires echange of secret keys
  \item Use of asymmetric crypto (e.g. Diffie-Hellman)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The D-H protocol is based on this formula: $g^b mod\ p$
    \item The RSA protocol is based on factorization: $C=M^e mod\ n$ and $p
\cdot g = n$
  \end{itemize}
  \item Security due to mathematical hardness of problems
  \item High energy consumption on resouce-constrained devices
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The use of a low frequency is more enery-consuming
  \end{itemize}
  \item Alternative approach: Information-theoretic security
\end{itemize}
