\chapter{Security threats}

There are different threats.

\section{Consumer Electronics - Entertainment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Privacy preserving search for content, again a case of searching with 
	encrypted queries
	\item DRM: the identity of the buyer is embedded in the purchased media 
	without disclosing it to the seller
	\item Compression: compression of (encrypted) multimedia data at non-trusted 
	nodes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Party Model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Trusted: Service is allowed to observe my data
	\item Honest but curious:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item adversaries correctly follow the protocol specification, yet may 
		attempt to lean additional information by analyzing the transcript of 
		messages received during the execution.
		\item weak security guarantee
	\end{itemize}
	\item Malicious:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item adversaries may behave arbitrarily and are not bound in any way 
		%missing stuff!! :(
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{An alternative approach: OT + GC}
OT stands for \textit{Oblivious Transfer}, while GC stands for \textit{Garbled 
Circuits}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Private computation of any function expressed as a logic (non 
	recursive) circuit
	\item Symmetric cryptography
	\item Inputs at the bit level
\end{itemize}
