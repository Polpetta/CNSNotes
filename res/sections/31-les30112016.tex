\chapter{Attack on IoT devices}

IoT devices aren't protected enough.
\section{Attestation}
A \textit{verifier} ascertains current state and/or behavior of 
\textit{prover}. An attestation requires a challenge between the verifier and 
the prover. This has to be little because the device doesn't have a lot of 
resource to compute large problems.
\subsection{Remote Attestation}
Remote attestation it0s a very popular topic, it could be software-based (so no 
more hardware components in the IoT device). The downside is that the 
\textit{prover} has to be near the \textit{verifier}, because it need to know 
who is.
