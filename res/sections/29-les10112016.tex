\section{On the Security of Next Generation Air-traffic Communications}

\subsection{Safety and Security}
The failure from a safety point of view is coming from a bug/internal
problems/user input. The failure from a secure point of view is coming from a
malicious actions.
In air traffic only safety was considered.

\subsection{Air Traffic Control - PSR}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ground based radar
		\item Measures the time difference between the signal transmission and 
		reflection
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Air Traffic Control - SSR}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR)
	\item Inspired by Identify Friend or Fow (IFF) during WWII
	\item Transponder-based interrogation
	\item Mode A: identification code only
	\item Mode C: identification code and barometric altitude
	\item Mode S: selective addressing to interrogate just one aircraft
	\item Mode S is used in Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ATC Today}

PSR and SSR were around for like 40 years, and now they are synchronized in one 
system.

The modern air-traffic navigation systems are moving to the satellite 
navigation (like GPS).

\subsubsection{Problems of ATC}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Old technology
	\item Enormous cost of operations
	\item It's difficult to have coverage in all parts of the world
	\item PSR
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Does not provide identity
		\item Often reports false targets
		\item High transmission power required for long-range performance
		\item Expensive to install and maintain
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Air Traffic Management of Tomorrow - ADS} The solution for the 
tomorrow is the ADS-B system, that will be mandatory in 2020.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{A}utomatic: Always on (no explicit interrogation necessary)
	\item \textbf{D}ependent: On-board system provides surveillance information 
	to other parties
	\item \textbf{S}urveillance: Provides precise position, altitude, speed, 
	heading, identification, ...
	\item \textbf{B}roadcast: Sent to any aircraft or ground station.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security in ADS-B}
\begin{itemize}
	\item No authentication
	\item No authorization
	\item No confidentiality
	\item No integrity
\end{itemize}
ADS-B system assumes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Received GPS data can be trusted
	\item Data broadcast over 1090ES data link can be trusted
\end{itemize}
